# WWF_Mini_Website
A [mini-website I created](https://guydavidwhittaker.com/WWF_Mini_Website/) based off three of the pages of [the WWF Australia website](https://wwf.org.au/) seen below (the design and apperance of which has since been modified) in order to practice and improve my frontend developer skills and knowledge. I recreated the home page, the news page, and meet the team page of the website.
